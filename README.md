# cm-challenge
cm challenge where you start at either the minimum/maximum sensitivity and you work your way to the opposite end

( originally 100cm - 6cm challenge )


## usage
input your dpi + game + minimum cm + maximum cm, and it'll return a series of sensitivities to use in-game with their corresponding cm value.


## supported game inputs and their corresponsing yaw values 
if your game isn't already here, you can just type in the yaw value instead.
